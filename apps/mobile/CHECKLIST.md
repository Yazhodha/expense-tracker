# Mobile App Setup Checklist

Use this checklist to track your progress setting up the mobile app.

## ☐ Step 1: Firebase Configuration Files

### Android (google-services.json)
- [ ] Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- [ ] Select expense-tracker project
- [ ] Add Android app with package name: `com.expensetracker.app`
- [ ] Download `google-services.json`
- [ ] Place file in: `/Users/yazhodha/expense-tracker/apps/mobile/google-services.json`
- [ ] Verify file exists: `ls -la apps/mobile/google-services.json`

### iOS (GoogleService-Info.plist)
- [ ] In same Firebase project
- [ ] Add iOS app with bundle ID: `com.expensetracker.app`
- [ ] Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
- [ ] Place file in: `/Users/yazhodha/expense-tracker/apps/mobile/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- [ ] Verify file exists: `ls -la apps/mobile/GoogleService-Info.plist`

## ☐ Step 2: Google Sign-In Configuration

- [ ] Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method
- [ ] Verify Google is enabled
- [ ] Click on Google provider
- [ ] Copy the **Web client ID**
- [ ] Create `.env` file: `cd apps/mobile && cp .env.example .env`
- [ ] Paste Web client ID into `.env` file
- [ ] Verify: `cat apps/mobile/.env` (should show your client ID)

## ☐ Step 3: Generate Native Projects

```bash
cd apps/mobile
npx expo prebuild --clean
```

- [ ] Command completes successfully
- [ ] See ✅ for iOS setup
- [ ] See ✅ for Android setup
- [ ] Folders created: `ios/` and `android/`

## ☐ Step 4: Run the App

### For iOS (Mac only):
```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

- [ ] App builds successfully (takes 5-10 min first time)
- [ ] iOS Simulator launches
- [ ] App installs and opens
- [ ] See login screen

### For Android (alternative):
```bash
npx expo run:android
```

- [ ] App builds successfully
- [ ] Android Emulator launches
- [ ] App installs and opens

## ☐ Step 5: Test Authentication

- [ ] Tap "Sign in with Google" button
- [ ] Google Sign-In sheet appears
- [ ] Select Google account
- [ ] Authentication succeeds
- [ ] See success toast message

## 🎉 Success Criteria

- [x] Authentication completes successfully
- [x] User profile loads from Firebase

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**Issue**: `npx expo prebuild` fails with Firebase error
**Fix**: Make sure config files are in `apps/mobile/` directory

**Issue**: Google Sign-In fails
**Fix**: Check `.env` has correct Web client ID (not iOS or Android ID)

**Issue**: App crashes on launch
**Fix**: Run `npx expo prebuild --clean` and try again

**Issue**: Can't find Firebase config
**Fix**: Verify files are named exactly:
- `google-services.json` (lowercase, no spaces)
- `GoogleService-Info.plist` (exact capitalization)

## Files You Should Have

After completing all steps:

```
apps/mobile/
├── google-services.json          ← From Firebase (Android)
├── GoogleService-Info.plist      ← From Firebase (iOS)
├── .env                          ← Created by you with Web client ID
├── ios/                          ← Generated by expo prebuild
├── android/                      ← Generated by expo prebuild
└── (other files already there)
```
